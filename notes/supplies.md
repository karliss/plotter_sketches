    * original rapidograph(1953), variant, variant B, foliograph, micronorm. Compatible nib. Visible air trap path combined with mounting thread.
    * isograph(1976-now), nib combined with collar. Supposed to be refillable from bottle, but rotring also sells (small) disposable cartridges. Different from rapidograph(1983) cartridges.
    * new rapidograph(1983) uses big "capillary" cartridges, skinny nib, airtrap is part of cartridge instead of nib

## Nib sizes and shapes

ISO sizes have ratio of √2 ≅ 1.4 . Drawings are supposed to have line thickness proportions of 1:2:4 for thin, normal and thick lines. Ratio of √2 allows easily getting this proprtion by skiping every other size, for example [0.13, 0.25, 0.5] , [0.18, 0.35. 0.7] or [0.25, 0.5. 1.0]

Newer Statedler marsmatic 750 ISO nibs follow the common color scheme well, but older ones even ISO sizes are all over the place.

Nibs following the ISO specificiation are often laballed with m̲̅ (m with horizontal lines above and under).

*) Color and number varies between generations
**) Color and number varies between generations. Size color accents are only on nib packaging and the pen body not the nib itself. Color of nib is based on type: S yellow, H(tungsten) green, J(jewel) red. 



Group refers to the interface between the nib and body maybe the ink reservoir, not the body and cap or body and holder(barell). Barell and cap compatibility can differ.

In case of long mounting thread, any air grove usually overlaps with mounting thread.

*) F versions with tungsten tip have the conical metal parts in golden color. J jeweled tip, P for etching inks.

**) 2 special versions 757 duranite (tungsten carbide), 759 jewel tip. Some of tungsten ones have golden cylinder (just like rotring), but there are versions that have metalic ring after hexagon instead.

***) Size is written like: 10 m/m. Some varioscript adds mention DIN 1451, which is a German font standard. Maybe size refers to which size text you can write using the corresponding nib instead of line width.

****) Not to be confused with regular isographs that have primus printed on.
