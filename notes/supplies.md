* rOtring isograph (historically used multiple other names: Rapidograph(FJ), Isograph, Variant, Varioscript, micronorm )
    - https://unofficialrotring.wordpress.com/2016/04/14/collecting-rotrings-technical-pens/
    - https://rotringmuseum.com/
    * original rapidograph(1953), variant, variant B, foliograph, micronorm. Compatible nib. Visible air trap path combined with mounting thread.
    * isograph(1976-now), nib combined with collar. Supposed to be refillable from bottle, but rotring also sells (small) disposable cartridges. Different from rapidograph(1983) cartridges.
    * new rapidograph(1983) uses big "capillary" cartridges, skinny nib, airtrap is part of cartridge instead of nib
* STAEDTLER Mars matic
* Koh-I-Noor® Rapidograph® (previously rapidograph trademark was owned and used by rOtring)
    * nib looks similar to Rotring Variant B
* Faber-Castel TG1-S (historically had other TG1 versions like TG1-J TG1-H)

* Hero 81A (China)
* isomars technoart (India?, their branding and product packaging seems to be heavily inspired by rOtring)
* liquidraw (website, branding and products seem identical to isomars. Alternative brand name? Whitelabelled product?)

## Nib sizes

ISO sizes have ratio of √2 ≅ 1.4 . Drawings are supposed to have line thickness proportions of 1:2:4 for thin, normal and thick lines. Ratio of √2 allows easily getting this proprtion by skiping every other size, for example [0.13, 0.25, 0.5] , [0.18, 0.35. 0.7] or [0.25, 0.5. 1.0]

Newer Statedler marsmatic 750 ISO nibs follow the common color scheme well, but older ones even ISO sizes are all over the place.

Nibs following the ISO specificiation are often laballed with m̲̅ (m with horizontal lines above and under).
