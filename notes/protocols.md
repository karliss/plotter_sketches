# HP-GL (and HP-GL/2)

Some materials mention HP-GL/2 and HP RTL, what are those?

HP RTL is protocol for raster printers, not relevant for pen plotters
The HP-GL/2 looks very similar to HP-GL, but it seemed to be described in context of device that support raster printing and other printing protocols. It's unclear if 

Exact scaling factor HP-GL devices is unclear. Many manuals say simply 0.025mm, some device manuals say "0.02488mm or 0.00098in", but there are also some that say "0.00098in 0.025mm". Does the real value vary between device models, are some of those simply inacurate rounding? It almost sounds like 0.02488mm is bad double conversation roundtrip. And that's just the HP docs, who knows what the other manufacturers implementing HP-GL do.

* 0.025mm = 40steps/mm = 1016steps/in (exact) ~= 0.00098425197in  | 100%
* 0.00098in=0.024892mm ~= 1020.408163 step/in ~= 40.173549 step/mm | 99.6%
* 1021step/in ~= 0.0009794319in ~= 0.024877571mm | 99.5%

Rounding error between 0.02488 and 0.025 might seem insignificant, but that's 1.5mm for A4 page or 3mm for A3 which can be easily measured and seen with naked eye.

# Roland CAMM-GL (I/II/III), DXG-GL, RD-GL (I, II, III)

The versioning is very weird. According to CAMM-GL II programmer's manual:
> Consideration has been made for to ensure compatibility with DXY-GL for plotters from
Roland DG Corp. and with CAMM-GL III for the CAMM-1 Series of cutting machines
(mode1), as well as with CAMM-GL I for the CAMM-3 Series of compact modeling
machines (mode1).

Many Roland plotters support two command modes, one slightly similar to GP-Gl and other quite similar to HP-GL.

DXG-GL, CAMM-GL mode 1 uses only 1 character commands while the GP-GL has some 2 character commands.

CAMM-GL devices have some 3 character commands prefixed by !, which can be used in both mode 1 and mode 2. These are usually Roland specific config commands which differ from GP-GL and HP-GL.

# GCode
Commonly used CNC mills, lathes, routers more recently also used by most FDM 3d printers. Popular choice for DIY machines with wide variety of available controller boards and firmwares. 

While basic commands are similar almost major manufacturer or firmware uses their own dialect. The biggest differences are usually related to:
* initialization
* homing procedure
* device configuration changes
* machine type and tool specific actions (needs of CNC mill are different from a lathe or 3d printer). For example 3d printer will have commands for controlling hotend temperature and synchronizing filament flow with movements, but CNC mills are more concerned with how fast the tool spins, tool size compensation and various routines for special operations like drilling or tapping. 
* macros and builtin scripting functionality

When possible check the documentation of relevant controller manufacturer or firmware.

* https://www.linuxcnc.org/documents/ the GCode dialect is based on RS274/NGC . LinuxCNC rarely used for pen plotters
* RS274/NGC - not to be confused with various RS274 standards, describes the NIST reference GCode interpreters (with actual source code not an abstract specification)
* RS274 - common name for various standards made by NIST and other standards organizations describing the GCode. As far as I am aware the text can be only obtained by paying like many other standards. Limited relevance for hobbyists since most controller firmwares follow it very loosely.

* https://github.com/gnea/grbl/wiki and https://github.com/gnea/grbl/wiki While the original GRBL itself isn't actively maintained and the supported hardware is outdated, there are many forks derived from GRBL supporting newer hardware which are using similar gcode dialect. There are also plenty of older (and not so old) DIY builds still using it.
